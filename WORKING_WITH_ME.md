# Working with Anders

I’ve been at dbt Labs for 6 months now. Lately, I’ve been reflecting on my experience acculturating to the organization and how I do my best work. One precept here is that of proactive communication. In the spirit of this, here’s an attempt to share how I work, think, and joke.

This is the first draft, I’m unsure as to what information is most valuable here. Some of the things are immediately apparent upon working with me, and you might not believe/observe some aspects for a while. 

 Major inspo credit to [Amy Nguyen](https://amy.dev/?p=979), [Adam Nathan](https://almanac.io/docs/ceo-user-guide-qgrX6JybtClEKUEGt96x5sMlzQLmRwPL), and [Tristan](https://www.notion.so/Working-with-Tristan-c7207974c30a4aaf809a6048ce73f897) (internal to dbt Labs)

Some good friends/colleagues have given me the following humorous and accurate descriptors:

> Anders is a talented, disorganized person liable to existential crisis

> The best way to get Anders to do something is to tell him not to do it

> Our whole team says the word utopia now because of how often Anders said it

> Anders, *when properly engaged*, can move a product forward in giant leaps at a time. His capacity for producing large volumes of high quality, readable, well designed code that will unblock major features quickly.

# Work Style

## Miscellaneous Must Mentions

- I’m a math teacher and data practioner by trade, working at a SaaS startup is rather new!
- I have deficit of Executive Function, planning and self-organizing are not my strong suits
- I’m a devotee of the [“no hello”](https://nohello.net/) movement. TL;DR. Don't DM me just "Hello", wait or me to respond, then DM me with what you want to tell/ask me. Just do it in one chunk!

## Motivators

I love

- helping people.
- collaborating with people
- solving hard problems.
- making [callbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(comedy))
- [portmanteau](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/portmanteau)-ing wherever opportunity presents

For better or worse, I’m a sucker for praise. It tells me that I'm being helpful. I struggle to be driven to do work when I don't know the 10,000 foot view ([Simon Sinek's Start with Why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)). Along those lines,  I work best when work is given to me in the following format. says to me things along the lines of

> Anders, I would love your help on `X`, because it would improve `Y`, which in turn helps accomplish long-term objective `Z`. I believe it should be done by `<DEADLINE>`. How about we jump on a call to break the work down in to smaller, incremental pieces?
> 

I’m seldom motivated by “being told to do it.” You can infer that I rarely did homework in school. Money is also not a big motivator for me; I’ve turned down higher offers before, and I suspect I will again in the future.

I dropped out of an online CS program in 2021. In almost all of my classes, the programming assignments were auto-graded, so we weren’t allowed to share or collaborate on any of our code. Most Sunday were spent alone on assignments, a very lonely endeavor for me. I’d jump to GitHub anytime I got a new issue notification for a dbt-related repo I maintained. I was much more motivated to help others around me, than to work on something for which I didn’t have the right motivation and incentives. This is what ultimately lead me to want to work at dbt Labs, then sense of meaning I derived from helping others around the world to make their lives easier.

I love conspiring with people and struggle without a feeling of collaboration. I know folks here hate kickoff meetings, but I’ve been thinking lately that they serve as a great social pressure lever, to understand the value of the work I do.

## My Strengths

- envisioning and proselytizing a utopia solution for a problem and working backwards
- teaching and enabling others to do more
- metaphorizing difficult concepts for better understanding
- building relationships and connecting people
- being “up-to-date” in the data industry, i.e. drinking hourly from the firehose of [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/news`), [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/), GitHub, [Locally Optimistic Slack](https://locallyoptimistic.com/community/), and of course, the [dbt community Slack](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community/).
- working at very high-levels and low-levels of abstraction (but I struggle to move between them)
- Callback jokes 😜

## My Weaknesses

I’ve been diagnosed with and in treatment for ADHD since the age of 12. However, [Executive Dysfunction](https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-executive-function-disorder/) more closely describes my challenges. There’s a lot of skills that are bucketed into this cognitive disorder that affects the pre-frontal cortex, but in the context of work I’d say that I’m challenged in the following areas as a result:

- executing on projects that I haven’t broken down into smaller pieces
- making long-term plans
- self-managing my time and dedicating chunks of time to “deep work” activities
- holding myself accountable to deadlines and commitments
- following up when folks ask me for “thoughts”
- writing! (there’s a lot of planning and organization that goes into this, but I aspire to do better)
- prooofreading 😜


## Ambitions
I would like to get better at:
- writing, or more specifically, starting and completing a shitty first draft
- effectively working asynchronously

# Communicating with me

## Hours

A few years ago when I was still working in-office, my working hours were normal and consistent. During the pandemic working remotely, my hours increased greatly. Now I’m in the tumultuous life of a new father, but I’m mostly available during the day and can respond within a few hours.

It’s also worth calling out that I run 2-3 minutes late to meetings, and, for in-person events, I’m about 8-13 minutes late.

My calendar reflects my up-to-date availability for chatting and meeting. I also use RescueTime to automatically update my Slack status to give people and idea of what I’m doing. If you see the 🗞, DM me and tell me to get back to work! 🫠

| Emoji | Activity | Program |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 📝 | Reading & Writing | Notion, GDrive |
| 🗞 | Reading “News” | [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/) Reddit, NYTimes |
| 🖥️ | “Coding” | VSCode, GitHub, dbt Cloud, etc |
| :calendar: / :handshake: | Meeting | VSCode, GitHub, dbt Cloud, etc |
| 💡 | FocusTime | Clockwise does this to facilitate deep work |


## Style

Across all mediums of communication I tend to be: assertive, enthusiastic, irreverent and light-heartedly sarcastic. I’m a big fan of ad-hoc, but I aspire to be someone who plans better.

## Channels

Here’s my person preference stack ranking of ways to reliably get in touch with me:

- Slack Thread
- GitHub
- Slack DM
- Meeting
- Notion
- Gmail

If I haven’t responded to something somewhere please ping me and remind me! Chances are I’m excited about it, but it dropped off the cliff of what my organizational and planning skills could handle.

## Feedback

I love candid, honest, and frequent feedback!
